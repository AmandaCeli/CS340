How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by following clean coding practices such as modular design, clear documentation, and consistent naming conventions.  In Project One, I created the AnimalShelter CRUD Python module as a self-contained class that handled all interactions with the MongoDB database through distinct methods for create, read, update, and delete operations.  By organizing the code in this way, I was able to reuse the same module in Project Two to connect the dashboard widgets directly to the database without rewriting any database logic.  This separation of concerns made the code easier to test, debug, and modify, since the data access layer was independent of the user interface.  The advantages of working in this way included faster development, reduced risk of introducing new errors, and improved flexibility when adding or changing dashboard features.  In the future, this CRUD module could be reused for other dashboards, API development, or data analysis tasks that require database access by adjusting the queries or connecting to a different MongoDB collection.  This approach ensures that my code remains scalable, efficient, and easy to adapt for future projects.




How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I approach problems as a computer scientist by breaking them into smaller, manageable components and using logical, data-driven methods to find efficient solutions.  For the Grazioso Salvare project, I started by analyzing the organizationâ€™s requirements to understand what data needed to be accessed and how it should be displayed on the dashboard.  I then designed and tested MongoDB queries to filter animals based on criteria such as type, age, and outcome before integrating those queries into interactive Dash widgets and visualizations.  Unlike previous assignments that focused mainly on backend logic or standalone programs, this project required combining database management with user interface design, which taught me the importance of connecting data to decision making through visualization.  In the future, I will use techniques such as entity-relationship modeling, query optimization, and modular coding to design efficient, scalable databases that align with client goals while ensuring the data can be easily visualized, filtered, and maintained through interactive applications.



What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists design and build systems that transform raw data into useful information, automate processes, and solve real-world problems efficiently.  Their work matters because it enables organizations to make data-driven decisions, streamline operations, and improve outcomes through technology.  In my project for Grazioso Salvare, I developed a dashboard that connected directly to a MongoDB database to display animal data in an interactive way.  This allowed the organization to easily search, filter, and visualize adoptable animals that met specific criteria, saving time and improving decision-making.  By turning complex datasets into accessible insights, my work as a computer scientist helps organizations like Grazioso Salvare operate more effectively, focus their resources where they are needed most, and ultimately achieve their mission successfully.
